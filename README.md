# Strongholds and Followers Framework

Framework for running Strongholds and followers in roll20 VTT

This is a character sheet for use with MCDM's Strogholds and followers ruleset and a Roll20 pro account.

To install you need to navigate to your game settings page. Set the character sheet to custom. Copy they above .html file content into the html tab. Then copy the .css file content into the css tab. Click save then load up your game.

Current Features are:

## Unit tab
* Rollable buttons for attack, power and morale save. These are currently set to always roll twice, I personally prefer this as you can decide after the fact if you rolled with advantage or disadvantage without slowing down the combat. This may change in the future based on feedback. 
* Traits and orders repeating section.
* An actions section where you can create a rollable macro based on variable inputs useful for battle magic.

## Stronghold tab
* Sections for keeping track of the stronghold stats, artisans and demesne effects.

You can see the sheet in action in this open game https://app.roll20.net/join/4198226/jujBPA

# Provinces 

nb. These are my place holder rules for managing provinces. When the Kingdoms and Warfare book is released I will update the sheet to reflect those rules.  

Provinces are areas of land (or sea) under the governance of a single entity say a Duke or a Count. That entity may be beholden to another say a King or an Emperor or may not be if it is a city state. This may contain a mixture of strongholds, population centers, and strategic resources. Changes to provinces happen over the period of multiple months or seasons to use the Strongholds and Followers vernacular. Each province has one or more Power Centre such as a house of parliament or moot it could even be a specific pirate ship. 

## General Attributes

<b>Population.</b> An abstracted measure of population in dice size ranging from d4 to d12 

<b>Unrest.</b> A measure of how satisfied the citizenry are this can be affected by incessant levies, lack of food, prescence of foreign actors such as a nearby barbarian camp.

<b>Development.</b> How developed the province is, 0 being a free for all wilderness and 5 being a province with well built roads and managed monsters and wildlife. It effects how quickly units can move throughout the province and how much upkeep is required for maintenance.

<b>Law.</b> Represents the potential forces that can be used to combat unrest. Law also applies a bonus to the morale of levied forces.
