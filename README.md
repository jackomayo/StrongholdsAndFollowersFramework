# Strongholds and Followers Framework

Framework for running Strongholds and followers in roll20 VTT

This is a character sheet for use with MCDM's Strogholds and followers ruleset and a Roll20 pro account.

To install you need to navigate to your game settings page. Set the character sheet to custom. Copy they above .html file content into the html tab. Then copy the .css file content into the css tab. Click save then load up your game.

Current Features are:

# Unit Tab
* Rollable buttons for attack, power and morale save. These are currently set to always roll twice, I personally prefer this as you can decide after the fact if you rolled with advantage or disadvantage without slowing down the combat. This may change in the future based on feedback. 
* Traits and orders repeating section.
* An actions section where you can create a rollable macro based on variable inputs useful for battle magic.

# Stronghold tab
* Sections for keeping track of the stronghold stats, artisans and demesne effects.

You can see the sheet in action in this open game https://app.roll20.net/join/4198226/jujBPA
